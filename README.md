# Meeting Transcription Assistant
This how rainsound.ai transcribes meetings from audio files. 

Just run the backend (python main.py) and frontend (npm run dev), upload an mp3 audio file of a meeting and press the transcribe button, then press the summarize button once that's finished and you'll have a nicely formatted summary of the meeting.
