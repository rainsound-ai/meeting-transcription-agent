### Meeting Summary

The meeting at [Rainsound.ai](http://rainsound.ai/) focused on discussing the current and future sales strategies, technical and AI-related concerns, and aligning on next steps for growth and customer outreach. Attendees included key team members such as Alex (Data Lead), Luca (AI Lead), Miles (Business Lead), and Aubrey (IT Lead), with a representative named Brent from an external consulting partner.

### Sales and Business Strategy

- **Miles:** Emphasized doubling down on relationships with large clients like Microsoft and developing a productized version of their consulting service. Miles articulated, "We’ve established a foundation with our relationship with Microsoft, such that we can play around a little bit. We have a little bit of wiggle room to pick the thing that’s going to get us to 5 million in 12 to 24 months."
- **Customer Targeting:** [Rainsound.ai](http://rainsound.ai/) aims to secure another significant client similar to Microsoft, with companies like Nvidia, Salesforce, IBM, Google, SAP, Oracle, and Amazon on their radar.
- **Client Relationships:** The team currently has varying confidence in partnerships with Tribai (more established) and Standard Android (less certain but promising with Nvidia).
- **Future Sales Roles:** There was a significant focus on potentially hiring a high-level sales figure, possibly starting in December, who can handle the sale of products and services as they become defined. "What we need right now today is help selling the shit that we’re already doing," Miles commented.

### Technical and AI Insights

- **Luca:** Discussed the company's evolution towards a productized service from consulting and the technical nuances of AI agent autonomy. Luca explained, "The language of agents implies a greater degree of autonomy... An agent can be an assistant, but there's more autonomy."
- **AI Hallucination:** Addressed handling AI hallucination in systems, highlighting techniques like "trust but verify," where the AI provides source material for claims it makes.
- **Defining AI Agents:** The shift from AI assistants to AI agents suggests higher autonomy and complex functionalities. Luca noted, "Many companies try and make like they have a great idea... Our approach is to work backwards from an audience."

### Key Quotes

- **Miles:** "Ultimately, we want to move towards a productized version of our consulting service."
- **Luca:** "The more autonomous something gets, the bigger the question marks are—how do you build it effectively? How do you make sure it’s doing the thing?"
- **Brent:** "The hardest thing is going to be which one do you get the most excited to do? Or do you just really like doing the hard stuff?"

### Speaker-Specific Insights

- **Miles:** Emphasized the urgency in refining and defining their offer, especially before major events like the VAM workshop and Microsoft Ignite.
- **Luca:** Focused on the technical development of AI agents, addressing privacy risks, system validation, and the necessity of aligning on the definition of AI agents.
- **Brent:** Stressed on the importance of clarity and the potential gap-filling role his team could play until [Rainsound.ai](http://rainsound.ai/) can hire a dedicated account executive.
